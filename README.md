### Performing object detection using the YOLOv4 model</h3>

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing object detection using the YOLOv4 model in a Google Colab environment. The code focuses on detecting people in an image.


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Requirements:

A Google Colab account

## Instructions:

Clone this repository to your Google Colab workspace.
Run the notebook cells (Cell > Run Cells) to execute the code.

### Explanation:

## The code performs the following steps:

# Downloads the necessary files:
yolov4.weights: Pre-trained weights for the YOLOv4 model.
yolov4.cfg: Configuration file defining the YOLOv4 architecture.
coco.names: A file containing class names corresponding to the COCO dataset.
# Sets up the object detection environment:
# Loads libraries like OpenCV and NumPy.
Defines confidence and Non-max Suppression (Nms) thresholds for filtering detections.
Reads class names from coco.names.
Loads the image (/content/bar_people.jpg) and the YOLOv4 model.
Configures the model to use GPU for faster processing (if available).
# Performs object detection and visualization:
Detects objects in the image using the YOLOv4 model.
Filters detections based on confidence and Nms thresholds.
Draws bounding boxes and labels for detected people.
Displays the image with the detections.


## Getting Started

This is a basic example and can be extended to detect other objects by modifying the confidence threshold and using the appropriate class names.
The code assumes the presence of an image named bar_people.jpg in the Colab workspace. You can replace this with your own image.

### Further Exlporation

Explore the YOLOv4 documentation for more details on the model and configuration options.
Experiment with different image datasets and object classes for detection.
